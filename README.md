# actual-number-backpropagation
This is a translation project of the excellent online post [A Step by Step Backpropagation Example](https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/) authoring by [Matt Mazur](matthew.h.mazur@gmail.com). The first propose is translating this tutorial from English to Chinese.

I recommend you use the excellent makrdown tool [Typora](https://typora.io/) to previews, edits the markdown documentation in our project, and exports it from .md to .pdf and .html. 

You can browse the markdown online version of [A Step by Step Backpropagation Example](./A_Step_by_Step_Backpropagation_Example.md).
